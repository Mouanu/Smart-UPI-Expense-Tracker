# 💸 Smart UPI Expense Tracker  
Turn your UPI transaction CSV into instant, private spending insights—no login needed.

---

## 📌 Why I’m Building This  
Most UPI apps like PhonePe, GPay, or Paytm just show a long list of transactions.  
But they don’t help you actually understand where your money goes, or what your financial patterns are.

I realized my own pain-points:

- Checking how much I sent a friend over a few months  
- Tracking spending on food delivery (Zomato, Swiggy, etc.)  
- Figuring out which categories drain my wallet most  

Endless scrolling and manual calculations made this tough.  
That’s why I’m creating a smarter tool where you simply upload a CSV and instantly see clear, actionable insights.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- ✅ Upload your PhonePe or GPay transaction CSV file  
- ✅ Automatic merchant categorization (e.g., Zomato = Food, Flipkart = Shopping)  
- ✅ See total amount sent or received from any contact  
- ✅ Filter insights by custom date ranges (e.g., Jan–Mar)  
- ✅ View per-month summaries and compare spending across months  
- ✅ Visualize spending via charts (pie charts, bar graphs, etc.)  
- ✅ Export insights or graphs as images or PDFs for sharing  
- ✅ No login required for core features—upload and analyze instantly

## 🔐 Your Data, Your Control  
**Privacy isn’t a feature—it’s a foundation.**

- 🔒 No login required for basic use  
- 🔒 Your uploaded CSV is processed locally in your browser  
- 🔒 No financial data is stored on servers unless you choose to save/export  
- 🔒 You can clear your session data at any time

## 🔍 Example Use Cases  

- “How much did I spend on Zomato in the last 3 months?”  
- “Between January and June, how much money did I send my best friend?”  
- “Which 5 categories eat up most of my money?”  
- “Am I spending more this month than the last?”  
- “Can I export this summary to share with my accountant or a friend?”
